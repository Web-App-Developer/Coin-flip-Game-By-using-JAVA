# Coin-flip-Game-By-using-JAVA
@@Game Explanation@@

Coin flipping, coin tossing, or heads or tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when it lands, in order to choose between two alternatives, sometimes used to resolve a dispute between two parties. It is a form of sortition which inherently has two possible outcomes. The party who calls the side that the coin lands on wins.
It used in alot of matches and bettings in the world.
I completed this Game by using JAVA.
